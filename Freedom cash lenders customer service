Check your credit: First, review your credit reports and check your credit score so you know what youâ€™re working with. If you spot any errors on your credit reports, it may be worth disputing them before you apply. 
Pre-qualify with multiple lenders: Many lenders let you pre-qualify for a loan online in minutes with no impact on your credit score. This lets you see your potential rates ahead of time. Comparing offers from multiple lenders can help you find an affordable loan.
